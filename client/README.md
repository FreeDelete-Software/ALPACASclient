# Client connection code from Godot demo

This folder contains code provided by the Godot engine available here:
[websocket_chat]( https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/networking/websocket_chat )

The code is not compatible with Evennia by default, and needs to be heavily 
modified to suit the ALPACASclient project. These modifications will be noted 
as clearly as possible.
